# Single-Cell-Omics
This is a repository for my efforts in analysing Single-Cell Omics data!

## Paper-implementation
-In this project I have tried to implement the paper "Unraveling Heterogeneity of Tumor Cells and Microenvironment and Its Clinical Implications for Triple Negative Breast Cancer" by Ke Jiang et al. (2021) PMID: 33854958.
-I have mostly tried to follow the coarse methodology mentioned in the paper, but have also used different tools and functions in places where the original ones used in the paper have become defunct or if I found a tool or function that is decreasing the number of steps, and is easier to implement and understand.
-The results that I received are quite different from the ones in the paper which might be because of difference in the way I performed cleaning and Quality control on the data, followed by usage of different parameters and the arguments passed for the various functions used throughout.
